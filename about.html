        <h1>Hi! Call me Sam.</h1>
        <p>I'm currently a senior at the University of Pittsburgh studying Information Science. I've done projects 
          with abroad and, most recently, with two Pittsburgh web design agencies, <a class="responsival" href="#">Responsival</a> 
          and <a class="redtree" href="#">RedTree Web Design</a>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>I am passionate about the design and development process and understanding the people behind technological solutions.
            I am searching for a full-time UI/UX Engineer, Web Developer, or Web Designer position after graduation.

    <section class="c12 about-info">
      <p>I jumped around a number of majors during my years in college, from Mathematics to Sociology to Computer Science, but I was drawn to the versatility
        and innovation present in Information Science. I was able to focus on the area of web design and development through this program,
        while also gaining exposure to other areas of tech, like databases and networks. Combined with my minor in Computer Science and 
        certificate in Digital Media, I have the tools to continually learn and create.
      </p>
      <h2>I focus in <span class="highlight">Frontend Development, Web Design, and Mobile App Design.</span></h2>
      <p>‚úàÔ∏è Ohio native and current Pittsburgher, I love traveling to new places and discovering new things. I enjoy exploring National Parks 
        and spent six weeks in South Africa last summer. I'm grateful for any chance to travel and learn from the world!
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        üé∂ Outside of work, band is my pastime. I am beginning my eighth (and final) year of marching band this fall playing piccolo, 
        but I have played flute for eleven years. Music can create the strongest bonds and I have been lucky enough to learn that. 
        I have learned true dedication and pride through our weekly practices and performances.
