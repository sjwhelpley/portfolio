        <h1>Hi! Call me Sam.</h1>
        <p>I'm currently a senior at the University of Pittsburgh studying Information Science. Some of my first projects were completed
          when studying abroad during the summer of 2019, but most recently, I've worked with two Pittsburgh web design agencies, <a class="responsival" href="https://www.responsival.com/">Responsival</a> 
          and <a class="redtree" href="https://redtreewebdesign.com/">RedTree Web Design</a>.
        </p>
        <p>I am passionate about the design and development process and understanding the people behind technological solutions.
            I am searching for a full-time Web Developer, Web Designer or UI/UX Engineer position after graduation.
        </p>
        <p>I jumped around a number of majors during my years in college, from Mathematics to Sociology to Computer Science, but I was drawn to the versatility
          and innovation present in Information Science. I was able to focus on the area of web design and development through this program
          while also gaining exposure to other areas of tech, like databases and networks. Combined with my minor in Computer Science and 
          certificate in Digital Media, I have the tools to continually learn and create.
        </p>
        <h2 id="focus">I focus in <span class="highlight">Frontend Development, Web Design, and Mobile App Design.</span></h2>
        <div class="fun-facts">
          <p>‚úàÔ∏è Ohio native and current Pittsburgher, I love traveling to new places and discovering new things. I enjoy exploring National Parks (see my project <a href="explore-national-parks">Explore National Parks</a>)
            and spent six weeks in South Africa last summer. I'm grateful for any chance to travel and learn from the world!
          </p>
          <p>
            üé∂ Outside of school and work, band is my pastime. I am beginning my eighth (and final) year of marching band Fall 2020 playing piccolo, 
            but I have played flute for eleven years. Music can create the strongest bonds and I have been lucky enough to experience that. 
            I have learned true dedication and pride through our weekly practices and performances.
